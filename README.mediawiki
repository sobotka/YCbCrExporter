== User Interface ==
It is hoped that the user interface is as discoverable as possible for artists. The following is a list of existing hotkeys:

: ~:	Scale to fit view
: 1:	Scale to 1:1 pixel view
: i:	Set export trim in to current frame
: o:	Set export trim out to current frame

Select between JPG or TIFF for lossy or lossless bitwise output respectively.

Select "Export" from the file menu.

== Current Limitations ==
It is assumed an experienced artist is aware of their actions, and zero checking is provided for existing file names. Be aware of your path and file names.

== Who? ==
Filmmakers and artists interested in extracting the highest possible quality from their Y'Cb'Cr' based footage.

== What? ==
YCbCr Exporter exports raw Y', Cb' and Cr' from 4:2:0 files. This means that an artist can dump the raw format from their motion picture files using a basic GUI for scrubbing and selecting ranges of frames.

== Why? ==
In processing YCbCr footage, many hidden transformations are applied to your footage. This application will create raw, bitwise exact output in a still image. This image can then be loaded into compositors or image manipulation applications to control the generation of RGB images.

This would greatly impact grading in a post production environment.

== How? ==
To harness the output from this application, the raw YCbCr image should be loaded into a suitable application. Note that many image manipulation applications will assume transfer curves on the image data, so this should be loaded as raw data. Once loaded, an artist can take the raw YCbCr, scale the Cb and Cr channels manually using the scaling algorithm of their choice, and recombine for a high quality image.

== When? ==
Typically, this would be useful once a final cut has been locked in and the sources can be selected and processed with certainty.
